#
# This file configures is one way you can configure your simeplogging loggers.
#
# From SimpleLogging: https://github.com/j256/simplelogging
#

# You can choose a specific log backend with:
#
# backend = type-or-class
#
# type-or-class can either be one of the enums in LogBackendType (ex: SLF4J) or a full class
# (ex: com.j256.simplelogging.backend.Slf4jLoggingLogBackend.Slf4jLoggingLogBackendFactory)

# You can set the global log level.  Setting it to NULL disables any previous calls to Logger.setGlobalLevel(...).
#
# global.level = INFO

# You can configure the backend discovery order.
#
# dicovery.order = ANDROID, LOGBACK, LOG4J2, SLF4J, LOG4J, LAMBDA, COMMONS_LOGGING, LOCAL, CONSOLE, JAVA_UTIL, NULL

# It also supports configuration for the LocalLogBackend in the format of:
#
# locallog.class-regex-pattern = level
#
# You should escape any period characters with a single backslash unless they are part of a regex match. For example:
#
#   locallog.com\.j256\.simplelogging.* = DEBUG
#

# invalid lines that are ignored
something
field = value

# configure the backend through a LogBackendType enum value
backend = LOCAL
# can also be as a class name of your own logger factory implementation
# backend = com.j256.simplelogging.backend.Slf4jLoggingLogBackend.Slf4jLoggingLogBackendFactory

# increase the log level for the local log backend for the package pattern loggers
locallog.com\.j256\.simplelogging\.LocalLogBackendTest = TRACE
