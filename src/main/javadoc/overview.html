<body>

<p> This package provides the core functionality for the lightweight
<a target="_top" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping" >Object Relational Mapping</a>
between Java classes and SQL databases.  There are certainly some <i>much</i> more mature packages which provide
this functionality, however, we wanted a simple wrapper around the JDBC functionality and other implementations
are significantly more complicated. The package supports natively a number of JDBC database types and also has
an package which uses direct Android database calls. Contact the author if your database type is not supported. </p>

<p> See the <a target="_top" href="doc-files/ormlite.html" >documentation</a> for more information.
